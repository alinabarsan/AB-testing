4. Can a user show up more than once in the activity table? Yes or no, and why?
--Yes, a user can make purchases on multiple days

5. Which of the following ways to increase statistical power 
are most likely to be out of our control?
--Decreasing variability of the dataset


6.Which is a way that we can consistently decrease 
the margin of error for a confidence interval?
--Increase the sample size

7.Would A/B test results be considered paired data? Yes or no, and why?
--No, because A/B testing involves each user only seeing one version of the test

8.Why is it best practice to set our significance level before we see our results?
--Because otherwise, we could change the significance level so our results 
appear significant, which would introduce bias

n=sqrt.24343 -> 156

3. What is the 95% confidence interval for the average amount spent per user 
in the treatment? 
Use the t distribution.
n=sqrt.24600 -> 157
xbar=3.39
df=156
t*=1.98
S=25.41
(3.073, 3.708)

4. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a 
difference in the average amount spent per user between the two groups. 
What are the resulting p-value and conclusion? 
Use the t distribution and a 5% significance level. 
Assume unequal variance.

WITH cte AS (
SELECT uid, "group", SUM(spent) AS total_spent
FROM groups
left join activity
using(uid)
GROUP BY uid,"group"
), cte_2 as
(select uid, "group", (COALESCE(total_spent, 0)) total_spent from cte)
select * from cte_2

then spreadsheet

Calculate the summary statistics for both groups:
For each group, find the sample size (n), the mean (x̄), and the standard deviation (s).

For Group A:
Sample size (nA): =COUNTIF(B:B,"A")
Mean (x̄A): =AVERAGEIF(B:B, "A", C:C)
Standard deviation (sA): =STDEV.S(FILTER(C:C, B:B="A"))

For Group B:
Sample size (nB): =COUNTIF(B:B,"B")
Mean (x̄B): =AVERAGEIF(B:B, "B", C:C)
Standard deviation (sB): =STDEV.S(FILTER(C:C, B:B="B"))

Welch's t-test:

Calculate the t-score: =(x̄A - x̄B) / SQRT((sA^2/nA) + (sB^2/nB)) (Replace x̄A, x̄B, sA, sB, nA, and nB with the respective formulas from step 3)

Degrees of freedom (df): =((sA^2/nA + sB^2/nB)^2) / ((sA^2/nA)^2/(nA-1) + (sB^2/nB)^2/(nB-1)) (Replace sA, sB, nA, and nB with the respective formulas from step 3)

Calculate the p-value: =2*(1-T.DIST(abs(t-score), df, TRUE)) (Replace t-score and df with the respective formulas from step 4)

Now, you can compare the p-value with the 5% significance level (α = 0.05). If the p-value is less than 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a difference in the average amount spent per user between the two groups. If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a difference in the average amount spent per user between the two groups.

p = 0.944, statistically insignificant. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean amount spent per user between the control and treatment.



5. What is the 95% confidence interval for 
the difference in the average amount spent per user 
between the treatment and the control (treatment-control)?
Use the t distribution and assume unequal variance.

CI = (x̄2 - x̄1) ± tα/2,df × SE

where:

x̄1 and x̄2 are the sample means for the two groups
tα/2,df is the critical t-value from the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom,
 where df = (n1 + n2 - 2) and α = 0.05/2 (since we want a two-tailed test
 with a 95% confidence interval)
SE is the standard error of the difference in means, which can be calculated as:
SE = sqrt[(s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)]

where s1 and s2 are the sample standard deviations for the two groups, 
and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes.

So, to find the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means, 
you would plug in the values for x̄1, x̄2, s1, s2, n1, and n2, and 
then use a t-table or calculator to find the value of tα/2,df. 
Once you have all the values, you can simply plug them into 
the formula above to find the confidence interval.

6.What is the user conversion rate for the control and treatment groups?
3.92 A
4.63 B




7.What is the 95% confidence interval for the 
conversion rate of users in the control? 
Use the normal distribution.

(0.036,0.041)


8.What is the 95% confidence interval for the 
conversion rate of users in the treatment?
Use the normal distribution.

(0.0437, 0.0489)


9.Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether 
there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. 
What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Use the normal distribution and a 5% significance level. 
Use the pooled proportion for the standard error.

z = (pB - pA) / SE
phat = (xA + xB) / (nA + nB)
se = np.sqrt(phat*(1-phat)*((1/n_a)+(1/n_b)))
p-value = 2 * NORM.S.DIST(-ABS(z))

p = 0.0001, statistically significant. 
We reject the null hypothesis that there 
is no difference in the user conversion rate between 
the control and treatment.


10.What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
the conversion rate between the treatment and control 
(treatment-control)? 
Use the normal distribution and unpooled proportions 
for the standard error.

Treatment proportion variance = Treatment proportion * (1 - Treatment proportion)
Control proportion variance = Control proportion * (1 - Control proportion)

(Treatment proportion - Control proportion) ± Z*√[(Treatment proportion variance/sample size of treatment) + (Control proportion variance/sample size of control)]

SE = √[(Treatment proportion variance/sample size of treatment) + (Control proportion variance/sample size of control)]

ME = Z * SE

(Treatment proportion - Control proportion) ± ME
